abstract = {In this paper, we present a framework for generating a synopsis of multi-view videos that are acquired from a surveillance site, indoor or outdoor, using multiple cameras. The synopsis generation is modeled as a scheduling problem that we solve using three separate approaches: table-driven approach, contradictory binary graph coloring (CBGC) approach, and simulated annealing (SA) based approach. An action recognition module is included in the framework to recognize important actions performed by various humans present in the videos. Inclusion of such important actions in the synopsis has helped to reduce its length significantly. The synopsis length is further reduced through a post-processing step that computes the visibility score for each object track using a fuzzy inference system. Among the three proposed schemes, maximum reduction in synopsis length is obtained through the CBGC approach. The stochastic approach using SA, on the other hand, achieves a better trade-off among the multiple optimization criteria. Experimental evaluations on standard datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework over its counterparts concerning the reduction in synopsis length and retention of important actions.},

Current research of it focuses on the methods of generating video synopsis or studying to utilize optimization algorithms such as fuzzy theory, minimum sparse reconstruction, and genetic algorithm to optimize its computing steps. This paper mainly studies the object-based video synopsis technology in distributed environment. We propose an effective video synopsis algorithm and a distributed processing model to accelerate the computing speed of video synopsis. The algorithm is proposed for studies of surveillance videos, which focuses on several key algorithmic steps, for instance, initialization of original video resources, background modeling, moving object detecting, and nonlinear rearrangement. These steps can be performed in parallel. In order to obtain good video synopsis effect and fast computing speed, some optimization methods are applied to these steps. With the aim of employing much more computing resources, we propose a distributed processing model, which splits the original video file into multiple segments and distributes them to different computing nodes to improve the computing performance by leveraging the multi-core and multi-thread capabilities of CPU. Experimental results show that the proposed distributed model can significantly improve the computing speed of video synopsis.},

abstract = {Abstract Video synopsis is an intelligent condensation approach to solve fast video browsing and retrieval for surveillance cameras. However, collision caused by unsatisfied tube rearrangement in traditional methods brings uncomfortable visual effect to users and how to mitigate the collision still remains an attracting topic. Unlike conventional methods that deal with tube rearrangement by minimizing a global energy function, we propose a novel approach by formulating it as a graph coloring problem. In our approach, all the tubes are firstly mapped into the spatial domain for analyzing their potential collision relationship. The input tube set is then represented by a graph structure, where each node stands for a tube and the edge between two nodes represents the potential collision relationship. To mitigate the collision artifacts, our method finds the mapping of tubes from original video to synopsis video by L(q)-coloring the graph, which separates tubes from their collision points. The parameter q is left tunable to make a compromise between collision artifacts and synopsis length, which can better meet users' demand of freely adjusting the compactness of synopsis video. The shifted objects are finally composited with the background image to obtain the high-quality video synopsis. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can generate more compact video synopsis with less collision artifacts than the existing methods.},

Much progress has recently been made using summarization of recorded video, but such techniques do not have much impact on live video surveillance. We assume a camera hierarchy where a Master camera observes the decision-critical region, and one or more Slave cameras observe regions where past activity is important for making the current decision. We propose that when people appear in the live Master camera, the Slave cameras will display their past activities, and the operator could use past information for real-time decision making. The basic units of our method are action tubes, representing objects and their trajectories over time. Our object-based method has advantages over frame based methods, as it can handle multiple people, multiple activities for each person, and can address re-identification uncertainty.},

abstract = {Efficient browsing of long video sequences is a key tool in visual surveillance, e.g., for postevent video forensics, but can also be used for fast review of motion pictures and home videos. While frame skipping (fixed or adaptive) is straightforward to implement, its performance is quite limited. Although more efficient techniques have been developed, such as video summarization and video montage, they lose either the temporal or semantic context of events. A recently proposed method called video synopsis deals with some of these issues but involves multiple processing stages and is fairly complex. Video condensation, that we propose here, is novel in the way information is removed from the space-time video volume, is conceptually simple and relatively easy to implement. We introduce the concept of a video ribbon inspired by that of a seam recently proposed for image resizing. We recursively carve ribbons out by minimizing an activity-aware cost function using dynamic programming. The ribbon model we develop is flexible and permits an easy adjustment of the compromise between temporal condensation ratio and anachronism of events. We also propose sliding-window ribbon carving to handle streaming video and demonstrate the method's efficiency on motor and pedestrian traffic data.},

In order to perform the intelligent video analysis task on the premise of preserving accuracy and controlling complexity, this paper presents a compressed-domain approach for massive surveillance video synopsis generation, labeling and browsing. The main work and achievements include: (1) a compressed-domain scheme is established to condense the compressed surveillance video and record the synopsis results; (2) a background modeling method via the Motion Vector based Local Binary Pattern (MVLBP) is introduced to extract moving objects in an efficient way; (3) an object flags based synopsis labeling method is proposed to represent the object regions as well as their display modes in a flexible way. Experimental results show that the video analysis system based on this framework can provide not only efficient synopsis generation but also flexible scalable or playback browsing. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Then, the sizes of the objects are reduced when collisions occur. Meanwhile, the geometric centroids of the objects will be kept unchanged to preserve the location information. Our contributions are threefold. First, an approach is proposed to decrease collisions in the synopsis video through reducing the sizes of the objects. Second, an optimization framework is developed to indicate the optimal time position and the appropriate reduction coefficient for each object. Finally, some metrics are proposed, and several experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed approach.

Since state-of-the-art online automated detection algorithms are far from perfect, much research effort on offline video surveillance has been made to prevent police or security staff from observing all recorded video frames unnecessarily. To solve the problem, this study focuses on video condensation, which provides fast monitoring of moving objects in a long duration of surveillance videos. Considering the computational complexity and the condensation ratio as the two main criteria for efficient video condensation, we propose a video condensation algorithm, which consists of the following: 1) initial condensation by discarding frames of nonmoving objects; 2) intra-GoFM (group of frames with moving objects) condensation; and 3) inter-GoFM condensation. In the intra-GoFM and inter-GoFM condensation, spatiotemporal static pixels within each GoFM and temporal static pixels between two consecutive GoFMs are dropped to shorten the temporal distances between consecutive moving objects. Experimental results show that our video condensation saves a significant amount of computational loads compared with the previous methods without sacrificing the condensation ratio and visual quality.},

A particle filter tracker is used to concatenate two trajectories if they belong to the same foreground activity, which generates more fluent tubes for video synopsis. Experimental results on 4 videos show that our method produces better accuracies and visual effects in video synopsis.},

abstract = {The amount of captured video is growing with the increased numbers of video cameras, especially the increase of millions of surveillance cameras that operate 24 hours a day. Since video browsing and retrieval is time consuming, most captured video is never watched or examined. Video synopsis is an effective tool for browsing and indexing of such a video. It provides a short video representation, while preserving the essential activities of the original video. The activity in the video is condensed into a shorter period by simultaneously showing multiple activities, even when they originally occurred at different times. The synopsis video is also an index into the original video by pointing to the original time of each activity. Video Synopsis can be applied to create a synopsis of an endless video streams, as generated by webcams and by surveillance cameras. It can address queries like "Show in one minute the synopsis of this camera broadcast during the past day''. This process includes two major phases: (i) An online conversion of the endless video stream into a database of objects and activities (rather than frames). (ii) A response phase, generating the video synopsis as a response to the user's query.},

As one of the most important supporting technologies, region of interest (ROI) information coding is a necessary part of fast browsing framework for surveillance video. Therefore, a novel coding method of object region flags and successful application of object mapping flags for the scalable browsing of surveillance video are proposed in this paper. This object region flags coding method includes both intra-frame coding and inter-frame coding, wherein, the former eliminates the redundancy in spatial domain by improving the scanning mode of region flags, the latter eliminates the redundancy in temporal domain, which cuts coding cost obviously and provides essential supports for video synopsis browsing of surveillance video.},

Since needless information is abundant in the raw videos, making video browsing and retrieval is inefficient and time consuming. Video synopsis is an effective way to browse and index such video, by pro- ducing a short video representation, while keeping the essen- tial activities of the original video. However, video synopsis for single camera is limited in its view scope, while under- standing and monitoring overall activity for large scenarios is valuable and demanding. To solve the above issues, we propose a novel video synopsis algorithm for partially over- lapping camera network. Our main contributions reside in three aspects: First, our algorithm can generate video syn- opsis for large scenarios, which can facilitate understand- ing overall activities. Second, for generating overall activity, we adopt a novel unsupervised graph matching algorithm to associate trajectories across cameras. Third, a novel multi- ple kernel similarity is adopted in selecting key observations for eliminating content redundancy in video synopsis. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on real surveillance videos captured by our camera network},

abstract = {Due to an increasing demand of video surveillance, there is an explosive growth of surveillance videos, which causes a big challenge in video storage, browsing and retrieval. The video synopsis technique is thus developed to extract and rearrange moving objects so as to handle the massive video browsing challenge. However, the traditional video synopsis (TVS) method only considers processing videos captured by a single camera, ignoring object interactions in multi-camera videos. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-camera joint video synopsis (JVS) algorithm for multi-camera surveillance videos. Firstly, a key time stamp (KTS) selection method is designed to find an object's appearing, merging, splitting, and disappearing moments in the frame sequence, called tube, of that object. Secondly, tubes are rearranged by minimizing a global energy function that involves the overall camera views. Compared with the energy function used in TVS, the proposed global energy function considers the chronological orders of tubes not only in the same camera view, but also among different camera views. Moreover, the chronological disorder cost term is formulated based on the KTS labels, and improved by considering the visual similarity between two tubes. Finally, the multi-camera synopsis videos are separately generated by stitching together the globally rearranged tubes and background images of the same camera view. Extensive experiments show that the proposed JVS method is better than the traditional single-camera video synopsis method in preserving chronological orders of moving objects among multi-camera synopsis videos},

Previous video synopsis methods, including frame-based and object-based approaches that remove valueless whole frames or combine objects from time shots, cannot handle videos with redundancies existing in the movements of video object. In this paper, we present a novel part-based object movements synopsis method, which can effectively compress the redundant information of a moving video object and represent the synopsized object seamlessly. Our method works by part-based assembling and stitching. The object movement sequence is first divided into several part movement sequences. Then, we optimally assemble moving parts from different part sequences together to produce an initial synopsis result. The optimal assembling is formulated as a part movement assignment problem on a Markov Random Field (MRF), which guarantees the most important moving parts are selected while preserving both the spatial compatibility between assembled parts and the chronological order of parts. Finally, we present a non-linear spatiotemporal optimization formulation to stitch the assembled parts seamlessly, and achieve the final compact video object synopsis. The experiments on a variety of input video objects have demonstrated the effectiveness of the presented synopsis method.},

But video browsing and retrieval are inconvenient due to inherent spatio-temporal redundancies, where some time intervals may have no activity, or have activities that occur in a small image region. Video synopsis aims to provide a compact video representation, while preserving the essential activities of the original video. We present dynamic video synopsis, where most of the activity in the video is condensed by simultaneously showing several actions, even when they originally occurred at different times. For example, we can create a "stroboscopic movie", where multiple dynamic instances of a moving object are played simultaneously. This is an extension of the still stroboscopic picture. Previous approaches for video abstraction addressed mostly the temporal redundancy by selecting representative key-frames or time intervals. In dynamic video synopsis the activity is shifted into a significantly shorter period, in which the activity is much denser.

abstract = {To reduce human efforts in browsing long surveillance videos, synopsis videos are proposed. Traditional synopsis video generation applying optimization on video tubes is very time consuming and infeasible for real-time online generation. This dilemma significantly reduces the feasibility of synopsis video generation in practical situations. To solve this problem, the synopsis video generation problem is formulated as a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation problem in this paper, where the positions and appearing frames of video objects are chronologically rearranged in real time without the need to know their complete trajectories. Moreover, a synopsis table is employed with MAP estimation to decide the temporal locations of the incoming foreground objects in the synopsis video without needing an optimization procedure. As a result, the computational complexity of the proposed video synopsis generation method can be significantly reduced. Furthermore, as it does not require prescreening the entire video, this approach can be applied on online streaming videos.},

abstract = {Video synopsis or condensation is a smart solution for fast video browsing and storage. However, most of the existing methods work offline, where two main phases are required. The first phase is to prepare tubes and background images. The second phase is to rearrange tubes and stitch them into backgrounds. However, with a long video sequence, the first phase is memory consuming for data storage, and the second phase is computationally expensive to rearrange all tubes simultaneously. To overcome these problems, we propose a high-performance video condensation system based on an online content-aware framework. The online framework transforms the optimization problem of tube rearrangement into a stepwise optimization problem. Therefore, it can condense video with much less memory and higher speed than the offline framework. With the aid of this transformation, the proposed system can process input videos and produce condensed videos simultaneously. Thus it is suitable for real-time endless surveillance videos. Meanwhile, the online mechanism allows users to directly visit the condensation video that has been generated. Moreover, the content-aware mechanism makes the proposed system able to automatically determine the duration of a condensed video. Finally, the proposed system uses Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) and multicore techniques to improve the speed. Extensive experiments that validate the high efficiency of the system are presented.},

abstract = {Reviewing video surveillance contents for security monitoring is a time-consuming and time-limiting task. This paper presents a real-time video surveillance summarization framework intended for minimizing the time requirement for time critical tasks, based on compact moving objects in time-space. A tunnel is proposed as an individual time-dimension object. In order to summarize an endless video into a shorter duration without loss of selected targets so as to extend the understanding of any given individual object, this research utilizes three real-time algorithms. Direct shift collision detection (DSCD) is implemented for the extremely fast shifting of tunnels together in time-space. The DSCD summarized video can then be customized by technique from many different approaches. Here, early trajectory searching is applied with the same DSCD technique, and then direct distance transform is used to instantly give the trajectory similarity between tunnels and the user's query. The most important step for identifying each individual object is background subtraction. To this end, dynamic region adaptation (DRA) was used as the background subtraction algorithm to select the best foreground for each object before making a tunnel. DRA also helps DSCD to summarize the video more accurately. The proposed framework is able to provide the results by real-time performance approach without losing the major events of the original video stream.},

With the size of the video collections growing to thousands of hours, technology is needed to effectively browse segments in a short time without losing the content of the video. We propose a method to extract the significant audio and video information and create a skim video which represents a very short synopsis of the original. The goal of this work is to show the utility of integrating language and image understanding techniques for video skimming by extraction of significant information, such as specific objects, audio keywords and relevant video structure. The resulting skim video is much shorter; where compaction is as high as 20:1, and yet retains the essential content of the original segment. We have conducted a user-study to test the content summarization and effectiveness of the skim as a browsing tool},

abstract = {We derive a statistical graphical model of video scenes with multiple, possibly occluded objects that can be efficiently used for tasks related to video search, browsing and retrieval. The model is trained on query (target) clip selected by the user. Shot retrieval process is based on the likelihood of a video frame under generative model. Instead of using a combination of weighted Euclidean distances as a shot similarity measure, the likelihood model automatically separates and balances various causes of variability in video, including occlusion, appearance change and motion. Thus, we overcome tedious and complex user interventions required in previous studies. We use the model in the adaptive video forward application that adapts video playback speed to the likelihood of the data. The similarity measure of each candidate clip to the target clip defines the playback speed. Given a query, the video is played at a higher speed as long as video content has low likelihood, and when frames similar to the query clip start to come in, the video playback rate drops. Set of experiments o12n typical home videos demonstrate performance, easiness and utility of our application.},

@article{Kolmogorov2004,
abstract = {In the last few years, several new algorithms based on graph cuts have been developed to solve energy minimization problems in computer vision. Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available.},
